### 0.6.0

* The site configuration file has been renamed from `site.py` to `config.py`.
  Old `site.py` files will continue to be recognised.

  Some Python installations were confusing the `site.py` file with the standard library's `site` module, causing the interpreter to crash when Ivy was run from the site directory.
